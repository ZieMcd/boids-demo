# boids-demo
This project is me attempting to implment [boids algorthim](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/) in Godot.

I've always founds boids very satisfying to look at and since I've starting learning a bit of Godot I thought I'd try implement them myself. \

I tried my best to try implement it with out copying from anyone else which probably resulted in some very bad and unoptimized code (I might try improve it later) but it gets the job done. \

There is a lot a Vector math involved which I haven't totally got the hang of, especially when normalizing Vectors.
